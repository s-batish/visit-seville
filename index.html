            <h2>About Seville</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Seville is one of Spain’s most impressive cities, with a remarkable reputation as a hub of
                <strong>culture,
                    history and beauty</strong>. It is the capital and largest city in the region of Andalusia, and is
                well
                worth the visit if you want to experience the vibrance and magnificence of Spanish life.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Seville is a city that is perfect for all visitors given the vast array of attractions it has to offer.

            <h2>When to visit</h2>
            <div id="visit-intro">
                <p>Seville is a lively, beautiful city to visit all year round – for this reason it is difficult to give
                    one
                    ideal time to visit. So, below you will find some information about the different seasons to visit
                    depending
                    on what you are looking for.</p>

                <h3>Peak high season (March-April)</h3>
                <h4>Best time to go for the <em>fiestas</em></h4>
                <p>As you will discover in our recommendations of things to do, both <em>Semana Santa</em> and the
                    <em>Feria de
                        Abril</em>, two of the
                    biggest festivals in this part of Spain, take place during these months. These are spectacles not to
                    be
                    missed, but, because of this, expect the city to be a lot busier and for transport and accommodation
                    prices
                    to be higher as a result.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>High season (May-June and September-October)</h3>
                <h4>Best time to be outdoors</h4>
                <p>These months are perfect for enjoying the stunning Sevillian weather that puts you right in the
                    holiday spirit. The
                    days are long, warm and sunny and the nights are still hot enough to continuing roaming around the
                    city, so you can
                    make full use of your days here to experience Seville to its maximum. The only downside to the
                    perfect conditions
                    during these months is that the city tends to be busier and prices tend to be higher.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Shoulder season (February and November)</h3>
                <h4>Best time to go for pleasant temperatures</h4>
                <p>February and November are ideal months for those who prefer a slightly cooler climate. While still
                    sunny and warm
                    during the days, the nights are a little colder, so a jacket or coat is definitely recommended.
                    There is also the
                    possibility of rain during these months, but this slight inconvenience is mitigated through the
                    fewer tourists and
                    lower prices that you will find.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Low season (December-January and July-August)</h3>
                <h4>Best time go for those on a budget</h4>
                <p>December and January are the coolest months in Seville, but because of this they are also the most
                    affordable. Don’t
                    let the chillier climate dissuade you from visiting, as Seville during December brings with it a
                    Christmassy glow
                    that will warm you up inside. On the other side of the scale, you have July and August which are the
                    hottest months,
                    not just in Seville, but the summers here are some of the warmest in Europe with temperatures
                    regularly exceeding 35°C.
                    On the plus side though, there will be fewer tourists who brave the streets during these months so
                    many of the attractions
                    will be quieter.</p>
