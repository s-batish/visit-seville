            <p>Seville is a lively, beautiful city to visit all year round – for this reason it is difficult to give one 
                ideal time to visit. So, below you will find some information about the different seasons to visit depending 
                on what you are looking for.</p>

            <h3>Peak high season (March-April)</h3>
            <h4>Best time to go for the <em>fiestas</em></h4>
            <p>As mentioned in our recommendations of things to do, both <em>Semana Santa</em> and the <em>Feria de Abril</em>, two of the 
                biggest festivals in this part of Spain, take place during these months. These are spectacles not to be 
                missed, but because of this expect the city to be a lot busier and for transport and accommodation prices 
                to be higher as a result of this.</p>
        <br>
            <h3>High season (May-June and September-October)</h3>
            <h4>Best time to be outdoors</h4>
            <p>These months are perfect for enjoying the stunning Sevillian weather that puts you right in the holiday spirit. The 
                days are long, warm and sunny and the nights are still hot enough to continuing roaming around the city so you can 
                make full use of your days here to experience Seville to its maximum. The only downside to the perfect conditions 
                during these months is that the city tends to be busier and prices tend to be higher.</p>
        <br>
            <h3>Shoulder season (February and November)</h3>
            <h4>Best time to go for pleasant temperatures</h4>
            <p>February and November are ideal months for those who prefer a slightly chillier climate. While still sunny and warm 
                during the days, the nights are a little cooler, so a jacket or coat is definitely recommended. There is also the 
                possibility of rain during these months, but this slight inconvenience is mitigated through the fewer tourists and 
                lower prices that you will find.</p>     
        <br>
            <h3>Low season (December-January and July-August)</h3>
            <h4>Best time go for those on a budget</h4>
            <p>December and January are the coolest months in Seville, but because of this they are also the most affordable. Don’t 
                let the chillier climate dissuade you from visiting, as Seville during December brings with it a Christmassy glow 
                that will warm you up inside. On the other side of the scale, you have July and August which are the hottest months, 
                not just in Seville, but the summers here are some of the warmest in Europe with temperatures regularly exceeding 35°C. 
                On the plus side though, there will be fewer tourists who brave the streets during these months so many of the attractions 
                will be quieter.</p>
