## Design

[When to visit wireframe](docs/when-to-visit-wireframe.png)
- Initially the 'When to visit' section of information was intended to be laid out on a separate page, which can be seen in the wireframe above. However, after a discussion with my mentor, it was decided that it looked better, and made more sense, to have this section of information on the homepage underneath the 'About Seville section' instead.

### Colour scheme

[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) was used to create the colour palette for the website.
### Typography
The following [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used for the typography for the website:
- Pacifico is used for the h1 logo
- Overlock is used for the h2 headings
- Lato is used for the h3 headings
- Hind Siliguri is used for the body text
## Features
The website is made up of six pages, four of which are accessible from the navigation menu (Home page, Things to do page, Gallery page, and Contact us page). The other two pages are a Thank you page, which is displayed once the user submits the form on the Contact us page, and a 404 page, which is displayed if a user tries to reach a non-existent page on the website.
### Common features
- Navigation bar
    - The navigation bar features at the top of each of the four main pages of the website, and it is sticky to ensure that it is always visible even when scrolling down the page.
    - It contains links to the Home, Things to do, Gallery and Contact us pages. The logo itself is also a link to the Home page.
    - The navigation bar is responsive on all devices. For mobiles and small devices, the navigation bar items are stacked in a column. But as the screen size increases, the menu items display horizontally and their font size, as well as the logo size, increase at various intervals, through the use of media queries.
    - A horizontal line displays underneath the active page that the user is on so that they can clearly see which page they are currently on. The horizontal line will also display underneath each menu item when the user hovers over it.

- Footer
    - The footer appears at the bottom of each of the four main pages and contains icons as links to social media websites that will open in a new tab. Aria labels have been used on the social media icons to ensure the footer is accessible to the visually impaired.

- Favicon
    - A favicon icon of the Spanish flag will display on every page of the website to make the website easily identifiable in the tabs header.

- 404 page
    - The 404 page has been implemented to display if a user is misdirected to a broken link. It has a 'Return to main website button' to direct the user to the home page without the need to click the back button on their browser.
