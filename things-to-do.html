            <p>Of course, this list is by no means exhaustive, as the infinite wonders of this location cannot be
                confined

                list, given the ever-evolving nature of the city. So, feel free to sign up to our monthly newsletter to
                keep

        <div id="plaza-de-espana">
            <h3>1) Go to the Plaza de España</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/plaza-de-espana.jpeg" alt="A wide shot photo of the Plaza de España">
            <p>This monumental spectacle, that is renowned for being the largest square in Seville, is one of the
                prettiest
                sites to explore during your visit. It was built for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929, but these
                days
                it is a popular tourist site where you can take a row boat along the Plaza’s moat, take a horse drawn
                carriage
                through the square or admire the beautiful representations of each of Spain’s provinces displayed on the
                majestic walls.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="maria-luisa-park">
            <h3>2) Wander around the María Luisa Park</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/maria-luisa-park.jpg" alt="María Luisa Park Pond">
            <p>This beautiful, immense public park is located in the centre of Seville and provides the perfect breath of 
                tranquillity within the city. It also offers some cool relief from the Sevillian sun, thanks to the shady 
                footpaths, fountains and the vast expanses of Mediterranean trees and colourful flowers, making it a popular 
                hub for both tourists and locals alike. It is also adjacent to the Plaza de España, so it is ideal to visit 
                both spaces at once.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="metropol-parasol">
            <h3>3) See the city views from the Metropol Parasol</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/metropol-parasol.jpg" alt="The Metropol Parasol with a view of the city in the background">
            <p>Known in Spanish as <em>Las Setas de Sevilla</em> (Seville’s Mushrooms), this is the perfect monument to witness 360° panoramic 
                views of this stunning city. It is the largest wooden structure in the world and its unique architectural design 
                makes this grand modern art piece a must see.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="cathedral">
            <h3>4) Visit Seville Cathedral</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/cathedral.jpg" alt="Seville Cathedral from a distance">
            <p>Seville Cathedral, the largest gothic cathedral in the world, is a magnificent UNESCO World Heritage Site, a well-deserved 
                acclaim given its magnitude and beauty. It is one of the most distinguished centrepieces of Seville, notably due to the 
                <em>Giralda</em> (the belltower) that can be seen from virtually any corner of the city, and the top of this impressive tower 
                is another location to take in the wonderous views of the Sevillian skyline. While inside the cathedral, be sure to 
                see the final burial place of Christopher Columbus who’s remains have laid here since 1898.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="alcazar">
            <h3>5) Marvel at the Royal Alcázar</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/alcazar.jpg" alt="Internal courtyard of the Royal Alcázar">
            <p>Another UNESCO World Heritage Site, this Royal Palace is the oldest European palace that is still in use today. The 
                grandeur and spectacle of this building and its gardens have to be seen first-hand to be truly appreciated, so it is no 
                surprise that the Royal Alcázar has featured in a number of films and television programmes.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="flamenco">
            <h3>6) Watch a Flamenco show</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/flamenco.jpeg" alt="Woman dancing flamenco in the Plaza de España with the band behind her">
            <p>Seville and flamenco have gone hand in hand for centuries with this beautiful art form being at the very heart of this city. 
                There are countless spaces all over Seville where you can witness these performances, so be sure not to miss out on watching 
                at least one of them. The <em>Museo del Baile Flamenco</em> (Flamenco Dance Museum) is recommended as a location where you can learn 
                about the history of the dance and witness a performance by one of its stars.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="triana">
            <h3>7) Explore the Triana region</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/triana.jpg" alt="View of the colourful buildings of Triana next to the river">
            <p>Located on the other side of the Guadalquivir River to the city centre, Triana is a vibrant, quaint district that is equally 
                as lively as the city centre, but it has a more local feel to it. Ramble down the <em>calles</em> (streets), that are surrounded by 
                Moorish buildings and baroque architecture, and visit some of the local shops that sell stunning little tiles and ceramics 
                that the area is known for. While on this side of the river, it is also worth visiting the <em>Mercado de Triana</em> (Triana Market) 
                which sells a range of authentic Spanish goods, from fresh produce to intricate crafts.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="fiestas">
            <h3>8) Experience Seville's fiestas</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/fiestas.jpg" alt="A woman dressed in traditional clothing next to two decorated horses during the April Fair">
            <p>Continuing its reputation as a lively, bubbly city, Seville never shies away from a festival and knows how to put on a spectacle. 
                Spring in Seville is one of the best times to experience these <em>fiestas</em>, starting off with <em>Semana Santa</em> (Holy Week) which 
                is celebrated in the week before Easter. During this week, that begins with a parade through the city streets on Palm Sunday, the entire 
                city comes alive with processions to commemorate the life of Christ, and as such a powerful celebration that takes place in few other places in 
                Spain, it is clear to see why it has been declared a Fiesta of International Tourist Interest. Two weeks later the celebrations continue 
                with the <em>Feria de Abril de Sevilla</em> (the Seville April Fair), which is another week-long extravaganza involving a lot of dancing, 
                drinking, eating and socialising and is an event not to be missed!</p>
