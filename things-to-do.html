            <h3>1) Go to the Plaza de España</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/plaza-de-espana.jpeg" alt="A wide shot photo of the Plaza de España">
            <p>This monumental spectacle, that is renowned for being the largest square in Seville, is one of the
                prettiest
                sites to explore during your visit. It was built for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929, but these
                days
                it is a popular tourist site where you can take a row boat along the Plaza’s moat, take a horse drawn
                carriage
                through the square or admire the beautiful representations of each of Spain’s provinces displayed on the
                majestic walls.</p>

        <div id="maria-luisa-park">
            <h3>2) Wander around the María Luisa Park</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/maria-luisa-park.jpg" alt="María Luisa Park Pond">
            <p>This beautiful, immense public park is located in the centre of Seville and provides the perfect breath of 
                tranquillity within the city. It also offers some cool relief from the Sevillian sun, thanks to the shady 
                footpaths, fountains and the vast expanses of Mediterranean trees and colourful flowers, making it a popular 
                hub for both tourists and locals alike. It is also adjacent to the Plaza de España, so it is ideal to visit 
                both spaces at once.</p>
