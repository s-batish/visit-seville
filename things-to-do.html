                    <h3>1) Go to the Plaza de España</h3>
                    <img src="assets/images/plaza-de-espana.webp" alt="A wide shot photo of the Plaza de España">
                    <p>This monumental spectacle, that is renowned for being the largest square in Seville, is one of
                        the prettiest sites to explore during your visit. It was built for the Ibero-American Exposition of
                        1929, but these days it is a popular tourist site where you can take a row boat along the Plaza’s moat, 
                        take a horse drawn carriage through the square or admire the beautiful representations of each of 
                        Spain’s provinces displayed on the majestic walls.</p>

                    <h3>2) Wander around the María Luisa Park</h3>
                    <img src="assets/images/maria-luisa-park.webp" alt="María Luisa Park Pond">
                    <p>This beautiful, immense public park is located in the centre of Seville and provides the perfect
                        breath of tranquillity within the city. It also offers some cool relief from the Sevillian sun, thanks
                        to the shady footpaths, fountains and the vast expanses of Mediterranean trees and colourful flowers,
                        making it a popular hub for both tourists and locals alike. It is also adjacent to the Plaza de España, so
                        it is ideal to visit both spaces at once.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="things-items">
                    <h3>3) Take in the views from the Metropol Parasol</h3>

                        alt="The Metropol Parasol with a view of the city in the background">
                    <p>Known in Spanish as <em>Las Setas de Sevilla</em> (Seville’s Mushrooms), this is the perfect
                        monument to witness 360° panoramic views of this stunning city. It is the largest wooden structure in the
                        world and its unique architectural design makes this grand modern art piece a must see.</p>

                <div class="things-items">
                    <h3>4) Visit Seville Cathedral</h3>
                    <img src="assets/images/cathedral.webp" alt="Seville Cathedral from a distance">
                    <p>Seville Cathedral, the largest gothic cathedral in the world, is a magnificent UNESCO World
                        Heritage Site, a well-deserved acclaim given its magnitude and beauty. It is one of the most
                        distinguished centrepieces of Seville, notably due to the <em>Giralda</em> (the belltower) that can be seen 
                        from virtually any corner of the city, and the top of this impressive tower is another location to take in 
                        the wonderous views of the Sevillian skyline. While inside the cathedral, be sure to see the final burial place 
                        of Christopher Columbus whose remains have laid here since 1898.</p>

                    <h3>5) Marvel at the Royal Alcázar</h3>
                    <img src="assets/images/alcazar.webp" alt="Internal courtyard of the Royal Alcázar">
                    <p>Another UNESCO World Heritage Site, this Royal Palace is the oldest European palace that is still
                        in use today. The grandeur and spectacle of this building and its gardens have to be seen first-hand to
                        be truly appreciated, so it is no surprise that the Royal Alcázar has featured in a number of films and
                        television programmes.</p>

                    <h3>6) Watch a Flamenco show</h3>

                        alt="Woman dancing flamenco in the Plaza de España with the band behind her">
                    <p>Seville and flamenco have gone hand in hand for centuries with this beautiful art form being at the very
                        heart of this city. There are countless spaces all over Seville where you can witness these
                        performances, so be sure not to miss out on watching at least one of them. The <em>Museo del Baile Flamenco</em> 
                        (Flamenco Dance Museum) is recommended as a location where you can learn about the history of the dance and 
                        witness a performance by some of its stars.</p>

                        alt="View of the colourful buildings of Triana next to the river">
                    <p>Located on the other side of the Guadalquivir River to the city centre, Triana is a vibrant,
                        quaint district that is equally as lively as the city centre, but with more of a local feel to it.
                        Ramble down the <em>calles</em> (streets), that are surrounded by Moorish buildings and baroque architecture, 
                        and visit some of the local shops that sell stunning little tiles and ceramics that the area is known for. While 
                        on this side of the river, it is also worth visiting the <em>Mercado de Triana</em> (Triana Market) which sells 
                        a range of authentic Spanish goods, from fresh produce to intricate crafts.</p>

                        alt="A woman dressed in traditional clothing next to two decorated horses during the April Fair">
                    <p>Continuing its reputation as a lively, bubbly city, Seville never shies away from a festival and knows how to put on 
                        a spectacle. Spring in Seville is one of the best times to experience these <em>fiestas</em>, starting off with
                        <em>Semana Santa</em> (Holy Week) which is celebrated in the week before Easter. During this week, that begins with a parade
                        through the city streets on Palm Sunday, the entire city comes alive with processions to
                        commemorate the life of Christ, and, as such a powerful celebration that takes place in few other places in Spain, it is clear 
                        to see why it has been declared a 'Fiesta of International Tourist Interest'. Two weeks later the celebrations continue with the
                        <em>Feria de Abril de Sevilla</em> (the Seville April Fair), which is another week-long extravaganza involving a lot of dancing,
                        drinking, eating and socialising, and is an event not to be missed!</p>
